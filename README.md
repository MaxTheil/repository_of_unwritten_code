# Repository of unwritten Code

**Hey Humans!**

> This repository is a chaotic collection of my small projects i.e. things I wanted to code - for the sake of coding. Thus, my snippets are more like a starting point.

> Nevertheless, don't hesitate to recommend changes or enhance my code. :)

**Known problems:**

- Web Scrapping Images: images could be queried using json. 

- Analysing Movie Data: - Actors were not analysed.
                        - Immaterial missings were dropped. However imputation might be better.
